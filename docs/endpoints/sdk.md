# MAGEhub Client SDKs

MAGEhub SDK is a software development kit based on the Endpoint provided by MAGEhub, which provides great convenience for users to quickly develop applications based on the MAGEhub chain.

Available in three languages:

- [warmage-sdk-go](https://github.com/warmage-sports/warmage-sdk-go)
- [warmage-sdk-js](https://github.com/warmage-sports/warmage-sdk-js)
- warmage-sdk-java (coming soon)

## Design Goals and Concepts

The SDK mainly implements the encapsulation of the functions of MAGEhub modules, including: auth, bank, gov, htlc, keys, nft, oracle, random, record, service, staking, token. So that users can quickly realize the development of the following functions:

- Generating, Signing and Broadcasting Transactions
- Private Key Management
- Subscribe Events
